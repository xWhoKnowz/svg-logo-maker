## Tests

To test this application you will need the node package jest. There are already preliminary test suites showcasing the functionality of the application as well as an exceptions test to ensure the text limit conditional is being enforced, these can be observed by running `npm run test`. Further testing can be conducted using jest and the AAA protocol demonstrated in the class constructor test suites.
